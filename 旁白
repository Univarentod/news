Here’s Zhang Ying, I am now in the Southern Campus. As soon as we arrived here, we went around to
view the situation of the main lawns in the campus. As can be seen here, the main lawns are pretty
intact. When walking around, we met a father who was playing with his child on the lawn. And not long 
later, they got asked to be out of the lawn by a guard riding a bike. But on another lawn not far 
from there, we got sight of a group of people taking photos without being asked out. According to 
some pedestrians, the security would be patrolling in the vicinity of the lawn, and will blow their
whistles to asked people out of the lawn. As a public good, the usage of the lawns is limited. Let’s
see how the residents and students think about this.
